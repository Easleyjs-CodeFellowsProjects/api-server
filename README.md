## Install instructions:

npm i express cors dotenv jest supertest

## Render.com URL:
https://basic-express-server-lx9c.onrender.com/

## Assignment instructions

Person Route
Method: GET
Path: /person
Expects a query string from the user with a “name” property
When present, output JSON to the client with this shape: { name: "name provided" }
Without a name in the query string, force a “500” error

index.js at the root of your repository, which will act as the “entry point” to your server.
should require src/server.js
should require dotenv, reading PORT from your .env file
It should call the .start() method from the server with the PORT set in your environment


src/server.js which will serve as your server ‘module’ … will contain all of the module connections for the server
Must export an object with a start() method (it should not start on it’s own) and a reference to the express app


## Create a middleware folder and add 2 middleware modules to it:
### logger.js
Performs a console.log with the request method and path
Import this into your server and set it up to run at the application level for all routes


### validator.js
Checks the query string for a name property
Sends the request through when valid, forces an error when not


## Create a error-handlers folder and add 2 modules to it:
404.js
Sends a 404/Not-Found message as the response
Import this into your server and set it up to be “used” after your other routes
500.js
Sends a 500/Server Error message as the response
Import this into your server and set it up to be “used” as the last route

## Create the /person route within your server.js
This route should use the validator middleware to check the user’s input
If valid, send a JSON object through the response with the name value in it
i.e. {"name": "fred" }

# Testing Requirements
## Assert the following
- 404 on a bad route
- 404 on a bad method
- 500 if no name in the query string
- 200 if the name is in the query string
- given an name in the query string, the output object is correct
