### SQL Models
- Create 2 SQL data models using the Sequelize library, make sure you export those model instances.
- Make sure your Models are configured with your SQL dialect and can properly connect to your database.

Your models should have appropriate field names declared with specific sequelize DataTypes.

### Routes
In your express server, create a route module for each data model that youâ€™ve created. Within the router module, create REST route handlers for each of the REST Methods that properly calls the correct CRUD method from the matching data model.

REST Method: POST
Path: /food

You should verify that only the fields you define get saved as a record.
